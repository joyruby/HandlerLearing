MultiThreadDemo is the entry;

There are two comparision to show the key of the Handler;

One comparision:

In another thread, handler's multiThreadTest is invoked. The result is obvious;

```
public static void compareInAnotherThread(final Handler handler){
        new Thread(new Runnable(){

            @Override
            public void run() {
                handler.multiThreadTest();
                System.out.println("compareInAnotherThread:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
        }).start();
    }
```


The other comparision:

A while without interuption is used to get the message from messagequeue; It is what we called looper;

```
public static void compareWithLooperThread(final Handler handler){
        final MessageQueue q = new MessageQueue();
        new Thread(new Runnable(){

            @Override
            public void run() {
                q.enqueueMessage(new Message(0));
                System.out.println("compareLooperThread:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
        }).start();
        while (true){
            handler.sendMessage(q.next());
        }
    }
```
